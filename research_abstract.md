Empirical studies in bacteria and eukaryotes show that stress can induce a state of mutagenesis â€“ a temporary increase in mutation rates. However, theoretical treatment of this phenomenon is lacking. 

Using mathematical models and computer simulations, I have developed a theoretical basis to explain the evolution of stress-induced mutagenesis. My results show that (i) stress-induced mutagenesis is favored by selection in both changing and constant environments due to the beneficial mutations it generates; and (ii) stress-induced mutagenesis increases the ability of populations to adapt to new environmental challenges without jeopardizing their ability to retain past adaptations.
In addition, I developed a new probabilistic approach to analyze the probability that a random mutation leads to an improved phenotype in Fisher's geometric model, a widely used model of adaptive evolution.

Because mutation is a fundamental evolutionary force, my PhD research has important significance to various aspects of biology. Most importantly, my research makes an important theoretical contribution to our understanding that mutation is more likely to occur in individuals who are mal-adapted to their environments and therefore are more likely to benefit from it.
